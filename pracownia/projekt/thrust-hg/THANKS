Thrust is an open source library of parallel algorithms with an interface
resembling the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).  The primary developers
of Thrust are Jared Hoberock [1] and Nathan Bell [2] of NVIDIA Research.

We wish to thank the following people, who have made important intellectual
and/or software contributions to the project:

 * Andrew Corrigan
 * Duane Merrill
 * Erich Elsen
 * Gregory Diamos
 * Mark Harris
 * Michael Garland
 * Nadathur Satish
 * Ryuta Suzuki
 * Shubho Sengupta
 * Thomas Bradley

We also thank the compiler group at NVIDIA for their continued improvements to
nvcc. In particular, we appreciate the work Bastiaan Aarts has done to enhance
nvcc's C++ support.

Lastly, Thrust has greatly benefited from the design and implementation of 
the Boost Iterator, Tuple, System, and Random Number libraries [3].
